	"description": "The perfect-time.de website was designed to allow visitors to place bids on \"special form\" auctions. Each bid will cost 50 cent, and each increases the cost of the product by 1 cent. If you win the auction, you have to pay the final \"cost\" of the product at that point.<br /><br />Note: This project is now offline.",
