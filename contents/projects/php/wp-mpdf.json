	"description": "This page is about a wordpress plugin I wrote, which allows you to convert any wordpress page/post into a pdf file. The plugin includes the mpdf PHP library.<br /><br />Furthermore, the plugin has a direct connection with Geshi, to allow highlighting of the source code in the PDF document. This plugin was written for a Magazine site about game programming, and replaces the old \"buggy\" PDF plugin.",
