The goal in this game is to gather as much coins as possible by controlling a 
small circle. But beware: there are also "bad" coins. If you gather one of 
these bad coins, the small circle explodes and you loose a life. You have 
3 lifes to begin with. The longer you persist, the more points you get. There 
are also special items which lead to both negative as positive bonus points 
so you have to be careful. Next to the local high score there is also an 
online high score.
